# North_Wind_Trader_SQL_Project

This analysis was carried out using PostgreSQL. The results were exported to Excel, and tables were created to add some formatting.

The Northwind Database contains the sales data for a fictitious company called “Northwind Traders,” which imports and exports specialty foods from around the world.

I have been employed as a Data Analyst to help the company answer some key questions to take the business forward.
